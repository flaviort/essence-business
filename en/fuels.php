						We are currently establishing an extremely important collaboration for both ESSENCE BUSINESS and our partners.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>In the coming months of 2023, we will announce a new alliance that will further diversify our group's activities.</strong><br /><br />

					Together with our respected international partners, we are about to formalize a medium-term contract for the <strong>supply of Diesel Oil, Fuels and other derivatives for the Brazilian market.</strong><br /><br />

					We fully recognize that Brazil still figures as an important importer of Petroleum Derivatives, covering a wide range of applications, from asphalt solutions to diesel, gasoline and other related products. This reality has brought us even closer to importers and manufacturers in this specific sector.

					Unfortunately, the transport routes that support Brazilian Agribusiness are high consumers of Diesel Oil, highlighting the vulnerability of our dependence on the volatile market, controlled by the main international producers. <strong>We recognize that ESSENCE BUSINESS has a strong approach towards the conscious consumption of renewable energy, with an emphasis on wind and photovoltaic sources.</strong>
